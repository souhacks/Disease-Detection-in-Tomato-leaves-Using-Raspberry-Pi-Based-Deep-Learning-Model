# Disease Detection in Tomato leaves Using Raspberry Pi-Based Deep Learning Model

This involved curating a dataset of images containing healthy and diseased leaves, preprocessing the images to enhance quality, and extracting features using computer vision techniques. I experimented with various machine learning models like SVM, CNN, and decision trees to classify the leaves and categorize diseases accurately.
