projects focused on the detection of leaf diseases in tomato. This involved curating a dataset of images containing healthy and diseased leaves, preprocessing the images to enhance quality, and extracting features using computer vision techniques. I experimented with various machine learning models like SVM, CNN, and decision trees to classify the leaves and categorize diseases accurately. Collaborating with hardware engineer, I integrated the developed algorithms with raspberry pi hardware, enabling real-time disease detection in the field. This integration provided farmers with timely insights to manage plant health effectively. Throughout the internship, I conducted thorough testing and validation, documenting the entire development process for knowledge transfer and future enhancements. This experience honed my skills in interdisciplinary research and practical application of technology in agriculture, laying a strong foundation for my career in the field.
